Welcome to [FLIM Imager](https://github.com/flim-labs/flim-imager-releases), a Tauri application dedicated to **real-time image acquisition and reconstruction**. This software offers a variety of customization tools, including colormap selection, contrast adjustment, ROI exploration, and image region selection for tailored analysis.

In addition, FLIM Imager provides comprehensive support for Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (**TCSPC**) analysis, both globally and at the single-pixel level and **Phasors** study. Powered by an underlying Rust-based data processor, FLIM Imager enables seamless data retrieval from hardware components and facilitates robust real-time visualization and analysis.

With an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), FLIM Imager is designed to meet the needs of users seeking dynamic image exploration and precise fluorescence lifetime analysis.
